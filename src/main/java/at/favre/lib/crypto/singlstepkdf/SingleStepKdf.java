/**
 * Single Step Key Derivation Function (KDF) as described in NIST SP 800-56Cr1 chapter 4.
 * <p>
 * Formally described as:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * A family of one-step key-derivation functions is specified as follows:
 * Function call: KDM( Z, OtherInput ).
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Options for the Auxiliary Function H:
 * <ul>
 * <li>H(x) = hash(x), where hash is an approved hash function meeting
 * the selection requirements specified in Section 7, and the input, x, is a bit string.</li>
 * <li>H(x) = HMAC-hash(salt, x), where HMAC-hash is an implementation of the
 * HMAC algorithm (as defined in [FIPS 198]) employing an approved hash function,
 * hash, that meets the selection requirements specified in Section 7.
 * An implementation-dependent byte string, salt, whose (non-null) value may
 * be optionally provided in OtherInput, serves as the HMAC key, and x (the
 * input to H) is a bit string that serves as the HMAC “message” – as specified
 * in [FIPS 198]. </li>
 * <li>H(x) = KMAC#(salt, x, H_outputBits, S), where KMAC# is a particular
 * implementation of either KMAC128 or KMAC256 (as defined in [SP 800-185])
 * that meets the selection requirements specified in Section 7. An
 * implementation-dependent byte string, salt, whose (non-null) value may be
 * optionally provided in OtherInput, serves as the KMAC# key, and x (the input
 * to H) is a bit string that serves as the KMAC# “message” – as specified in [SP800-185].
 * The parameter H_outputBits determines the bit length chosen for the output of the
 * KMAC variant employed. The “customization string” S shall be the byte string
 * 01001011 || 01000100 || 01000110, which represents the
 * sequence of characters “K”, “D”, and “F” in 8-bit ASCII. (This three-byte
 * string is denoted by “KDF” in this document.)</li>
 * </ul>
